# About the App

Find Odd is an exciting NPM package that also doubles as a command line app for word game enthusiasts. This app presents users with a set of options and asks them to identify the word that does not belong. If the user selects the correct word, the difficulty level increases, and if they fail, the app awards them points. This engaging word game can be played from the terminal, making it accessible to all. Whether you're looking for a fun way to pass the time or want to improve your cognitive skills, Find Odd is an excellent choice for you.
