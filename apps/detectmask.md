# About the App

Detect Mask is a PWA app that uses the power of machine learning to detect whether a user is wearing a mask or not. Trained on ImageNet and using the mobilenet model, the app works offline and can be used on kiosks. Simply point the camera at the user's face and the app will detect if they are wearing a mask or not. This is a useful tool for businesses, organizations, and individuals who want to enforce mask-wearing policies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. With its offline functionality, the app can be used anywhere without the need for an internet connection.
