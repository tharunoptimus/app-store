# About the App

Face Reaction is a progressive web app (PWA) that detects facial expressions and emotions in real time using the face-api.js machine learning library. With the help of your device's camera, the app analyzes your facial features and provides instant feedback on your emotional state. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral, Face Reaction can accurately identify and display your emotional expression. Use it for fun, as a tool for practicing empathy, or as a way to improve your emotional intelligence. Best of all, the app works offline and requires no installation, so you can use it on any device with a camera and a web browser.
